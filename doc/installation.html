<H2><A NAME="Intro"></A>Introduction</H2>

<P><I>SSA</I> is a tool to assign the secondary structure of a peptide
from its atomic coordinates in PDB format based on their superposition
with sequences of ideal secondary structure. <I>SSA</I> was developed
by members of the <A
HREF="http://www.bch.msu.edu/labs/kuhn/index.html">Protein Structural
Analysis and Design Laboratory</A> at <A
HREF="http://www.msu.edu/">Michigan State University</A>, and was
supported by funding from the MSU Vice Provost for Libraries,
      Computing, & Technology and from the Department of
      Biochemistry.</P>

<I>SSA</i> is designed to work on 4-residue peptide fragments
    (approximately reflecting the periodicity of helices and reverse
    turns and two repeats within beta-strand) and is most often
    coupled for use with <I>Sequery</i>, which performs sequence
    pattern searches of the Protein Data Bank (PDB). For more
    information and software availability on <I>Sequery</i>, see <A
    href="http://www.bch.msu.edu/labs/kuhn/web/doc/sequery_doc.html">
    <I>Sequery</i> Information and Documentation</a>.

<H2><A NAME="Install"></A>Getting and Installing <I>SSA</I></H2>

<I>SSA</i> was designed and written for use on a UNIX workstation with
a C-compiler and tested on Sun and Silicon Graphics workstations,
though it should work on any system with a C-compiler installed and
access to the Protein Data Bank. Implicit declaration errors may occur
during compilation with the GNU C-compiler (gcc), but these errors do
not affect program compilation or execution. Additional errors may be
reported during compiltion with the SGI C-compiler, but these will
also have no effect on compilation or execution.

<P>The latest version of <I>SSA</I>, as well as the most recent
version of this documentation, can be found at the home page for the
<A HREF="http://www.bch.msu.edu/labs/kuhn/index.html">Protein
Structural Analysis and Design Laboratory</A>, <A
HREF="http://www.bch.msu.edu/">Department of Biochemistry, Michigan
State University</A>. To install <I>SSA</I>, perform the following
steps:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Download <A
HREF="http://www.bch.msu.edu/labs/kuhn/web/software/ssa/ssa3.0.tar.Z">ssa3.0.tar.Z</A></LI>

<LI>Place this file in the directory where you wish to install
the software, and enter the following command:</LI>

<UL>
<P><TT>zcat ssa3.0.tar.Z | tar xvf -</TT></P>
</UL>

<LI>To compile the software,
      <ol>
	<LI>change directory to <tt>SourceFiles</tt>
	<LI>type <tt>make install</tt>
      </ol>
<LI>To finish installation, 
	<ol>
	  <LI>edit <tt>SourceFiles/runssa</tt> script in the following
      manner:<BR>
      set <tt>PDBHOME</tt> to the directory containing the PDB
      database on your system<br>
      set <tt>ssahome</tt> to the directory where you installed
      <I>SSA</i> using the full and explicit path. 
	</ol>
<LI>To run <I>SSA</I>, use the <TT>runssa</TT> script in the
installation/bin directory. For example, if <I>SSA</I> is installed in
<TT>/usr/local/biochem/SSA</TT>, then you would use the command:
<TT>/usr/local/biochem/SSA/bin/runssa </TT>to run the
	  software. Further information on the use of <I>SSA</i> can
	  be found in <a href="use.html">Using <I>SSA</i></a></LI>

<H3><A NAME="Shells"></A>Troubleshooting Shell Scripts</H3>

 <P><TT>ssa/SourceFiles/runssa</TT> and <tt>ssa/share/genbcl</tt> are
 C-shell scripts. They assume the C-shell is installed in the standard
 location as <tt>/bin/csh</tt>.  If you have difficulty running this
 script, try editing the first line of each script to point to the
 correct shell location for your system. Also verify these files are
 set with the proper executable permissions.

<H2><A NAME="Det"></A>Algorithmic Details of <I>SSA</I></H2>

<P>
      <I>SSA</I> uses superpositional analysis to assign secondary
      structure to short peptidyl segments (4 residues in its current
      implementation). The basic algorithmic procedure is as follows:

    <OL>
      <LI>Superimpose the tetrapeptide in question onto each of the 7
	template teptrapeptides (alpha-helix, beta-strand, type I
	turn, type II turn, type I' turn, type II' turn, type VIII
	turn). The alpha-helix and beta-strand templates were
	generated using the phi-psi values in <I>InsightII</i> (MSI,
	San Diego, CA) and the reverse turn templates were generated
	using the phi-psi angles for average turns as reported in <P>
	  Hutchinson EG, Thornton JM<BR>
	  <STRONG>A revised set of potentials for beta-turn formation
	    in proteins</strong><br>
	  <I>Prot. Sci.</i>, <B>3(12)</b> (Dec): 2207-2216 (1994)<p> 

      <LI>Assign the structure type based on a threshold of <
      0.75&nbsp;&Aring; main-chain (N,C-alpha, C, O) RMSD using the
      following algorithm
	<UL>
	  <LI>If the tetrapeptide matches the beta-strand template,
	    assign as beta-strand (EXTE).

	  <LI>If the tetrapeptide matches the helix template, check
	    the structure of the tetrapeptide found by shifting one
	    residue upstream and the structure of the tetrapeptide found
	    by shifting one residue downstream against the helix
	    template.
	    <UL>
	      <LI>If one OR the other of the shifted peptides also 
		match the helix template, assign as helix (HELI).
	      <LI>If NEITHER of the shifted peptides match the helix
		template, check futher
	    </ul>
	  <LI>If the tetrapeptide matches one of the turn templates,
	    assign as turn type with the lowest RMSD (type 1 = TUR1;
	    type 1' = TT1P; type 2 = TUR2; type 2' = TT2P; or type 8 =
	    TUR8)
	  <LI>If the tetrapeptide matches none of the templates,
	    calculate the C-alpha(i) to C-alpha(i+3) distance.
	    <UL>
	      <LI>If this distance is LESS than 7.0&nbsp;&Aring;, check the
		structure of the tetrapeptide found by shifting one
		residue upstream and the structure of the tetrapeptide
		found by shifting one residue downstream against the
		helix template.
		<UL>
		  <LI>If one OR the other of the shifted peptides also 
		    match the helix template, assign as irregular
		    helix (HIRR).
		  <LI>If NEITHER match the helix template, assign as
		    irregular turn (TIRR).
		</UL>
	      <LI>If this distance is GREATER than 7.0&nbsp;&Aring;,
		assign as irregular (IRRE).
	    </ul>
	</ul>
      </ol>
